// What is a variable?
var a = 1; 
var b = 2; 
console.log(a + b); // 3

//notes on variables:
//1)  a variable must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
//2)  numbers may follow the above characters, but cannot come first
//3)  JavaScript is case sensitive-- 'hello' and 'HeLlo' are different variables

/*
Declarations are the LEFT SIDE of a variable
  It is simply the var x
  It is on the left side of the assignment operator (=)

Initializations are the RIGHT SIDE of a variable
  It sets the value of the variable
  It incorporates the variable name (x), the assignment operator (=), and the value (10) => x = 10

We've talked before about how every variable is basically a storage container in JavaScript
think of variables with null and undefined as packages coming out of UPS
null packages are packages that were intentionally packed up with nothing, but have been assembled
undefined packages are packages that have nothing in them, but have not yet been assembled to leave UPS

// Strings
// Strings = any value within quotes; JS spits out value within the quotes

// Numbers vs. Strings
let first = 1050 + 100;

/*
What's going on here?
Addition vs. Concatenation

When JS sees combining two or more numbers, it adds the values together using the built-in math functionality; when it sees adding together one or more strings, it changes and the plus sign becomes an assignment operator--it smashes the values together without trying to synthesize the values

With the plus operator, if 1 string and 1 number are given to the plus sign, it returns a string

/*
WHAT?? Why is typeof coming back with an object, and not array??

What is the definition of objects again? A container that can hold multiple datatypes

Notice that arrays, too, are a container that can hold multiple datatypes.  Therefore, JS has classified arrays as objects and not a datatype of their own
