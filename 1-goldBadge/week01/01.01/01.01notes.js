Variables, Types, Console.log Assignment:
Challenge 1:
Make 3 variables.  Your first variable should be a string.  Your second variable should be an array, which
has a string inside.  Your final variable should be an object, which has a property which is a string.

Write 3 console.log messages which show the string from each type of variable.

Challenge 2:
Make 7 variables: one is a string, one a number, one a boolean, one is undefined, one null, one
an array, and one an object.  Write a console.log message showing the type of each variable.  What
surprises you about this?

Challenge 3:
Make 2 variables.  The first is an array, the second is an object.  Inside each variable, store a string,
a number, a boolean, an undefined, a null, an array, and an object.
Once you've defined each variable, use console.log messages to output every value within your array and
your object.
