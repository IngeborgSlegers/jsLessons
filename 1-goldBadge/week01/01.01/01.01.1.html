        1. Professionalism: 
        This is a job training program, which means youre developing skills to enter into a professional field Dress like this is high school, which just means no pjs please. Presentation days =  business to business casual. Lateness, try to be on time, we understand traffic can be troublesome in fishers, but if youre late every day, we need to have a conversation. Please dont sleep in class. This is a tough track you will be tired, but try going for a walk, or going to sit out in the open area, or if you dont well please feel free to go home.

        2. Grading: There are a couple of things well be using to tracking your progress. Were going to use Repl and WhiteBoard Challenges as a sort of quiz or benchmark to help you keep track of where your weaknesses and strengths are. Well look for completion but they wont neccesarily be graded. We will be grading 4 different projects that we will give you over the course of the next three weeks. For those projects well be grading on Professionalism, Presentation Flow, Ability to speak to speak about your code confidently effort during work times, and the actual project meeting requirements given .


    Note on Notes and Studying:
      Notes on your machine, will give time to write notes but be quick,
      rewrite notes later, watch videos later,
      this is immersive learning, so youll do best trying something 
      making notes after you write code can help to solidify what youve just done. 
      Also try to find out how you learn best?  Visual(a seer), Auditory(a listener), Kenesthetic(a doer)
