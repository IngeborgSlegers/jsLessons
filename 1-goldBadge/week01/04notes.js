HTML/CSS Exercise:
Using an html file with a linked css file, make a brief page (no header or footer needed) which explains
the 2 things that help you greatly in learning code and the 2 things you struggle with mightily in learning
code.  Feel free to design this however you want, but use your time (45 minutes) to build this out and have
fun.  We'll use the 15 minutes following this exercise to show off some of our work!

Array and Object challenges:
Challenge 1:
Build an array that has a string, a boolean, another array, an object, and a number inside.  Write a separate
console.log to show every value within the array.  Once you've done that, use a for-of loop to console.log
every value within the array.  If you can get the for-of loop to work correctly, try this with a .forEach.

Challenge 2:
Build an array with the values: 'swimming', 'running', 'yoga', 'biking', 'climbing'.  Add the value
'stretching' with splice, but don't remove any contents in the array.  Add the value 'basketball' with
splice, but *do* remove one element
