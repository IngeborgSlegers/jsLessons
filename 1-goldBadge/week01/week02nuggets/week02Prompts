First challenge:
Write an array of numbers.  Write a for loop that console.logs 'your number is even' if the number is even
and 'your number is odd' if your number is odd.

Once you've solved this with a for loop, solve this with a for-of loop.  Finally, solve this with a 
forEach loop.

Second challenge:
Write a function that accepts an object as input.  Your function should return an array that has
four elements inside: a)  an array of all the keys in the object,
b)  an array of all the values in the object, c)  the number of key-value pairs in the object

Make sure to console.log what your function returns so you can see it!

Third challenge:
Write a function that has a loop.  The loop should run 10 times and call a second function.  Every time
the second function is called, it should add a little bit more to a variable passed to it from the first
function.  Once the loop is finished, return the variable within the first function.

Here's a hint to get you started:

Inside first function:
  make a variable
  start the loop
    call the second function which adds to the variable
    call the second function again
    ...
  end the loop
  return the variable

Outside first function:
  console.log the returned variable
