// ? Explain APIs
/* 
? API stands for Application Program Interface
? - in basic terms, APIs just allow applications to communicate with one another.
? - the API is not the database or even the server, it is the code that allows us access point(s) to the server.
? - those access points come in the form of an endpoint, which directs us to different sets of data we can access
*/

// ? Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.

// ? As a real-world example, think about the electricity supply in your house, apartment, or other dwellings. If you want to use an appliance in your house, you simply plug it into a plug socket and it works. You don't try to wire it directly into the power supply â€” to do so would be really inefficient and, if you are not an electrician, difficult and dangerous to attempt.

function fetchSpace(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  // console.log(e);

  // ? Explain Fetch and Async Programming

  // ? Async Programming is what happens when even though we write our code in a specific order, we want the data to come back in a different order. Sometimes, we want our code to wait to execute until AFTER we have gotten specific data back.
  // ? If a function relies on the result of another function, it has to wait for the other function to finish and return, and until that happens, the entire program is essentially stopped from the perspective of the user.

  // ? Generally, code is read and implemented line by line - this is known as synchronous programming
  // ? In the case of fetching data from an outside source like we do with an API, if JavaScript did not have the ability to run code asynchronously, it would have to run each line of code > wait for the response from the API > and then finish running the rest of our code.
  // ? If you think about thousands of users trying to request information from an API all at once, and each user had to wait for each response to finish running before reading and implementing the rest of the code, this could easily halt an application from running
  // ? Asynchronous programming allows our code to continue to run while we're waiting on a response from an API. Once the fetch has finished retrieving the data, it then presents us with that data, without having to wait on any other processes

  // ? Fetch() is method which starts the process of fetching a resource from the network, returning a promise which is fulfilled once the response is available. The promise resolves to the Response object representing the response to your request.

  //? fetch() starts the process of fetching a resource from a network, and that fetch returns a promise which is fulfilled once the response is available - ASYNCHRONOUS! A promise simply represents the eventual completion (or failure - this is generally due to a network error) of an asynchronous operation.

    // ? Explain promises

    // ? Promises are a built-in language feature of JavaScript and makes handling asynchronous code easier and more readable. Promises are basically objects representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. 
    // ? The promise constructor takes one argument which is a callback with two parameters, `resolve` and `reject`. Do something within the callback, then call resolve if everything worked, otherwise call reject.
    // ? We can chain multiple promises one after another with .then() chaining.
    // ? The deep reason why promises are often better is that they're more composable, which roughly means that combining multiple promises "just works" while combining multiple callbacks often doesn't.
    
    .then(result => {
      // console.log(result);
      return result.json();
    })
    .then(json => {
      // console.log(json);

      // ? Explain callbacks

      // ? A callback function in its simplest terms is a function that is passed to another function, as a parameter. The callback function then gets executed inside the function where it is passed and the final result is returned to the caller.
      // ? This is an immensely useful feature of functional programming as callbacks lets us handle code asynchronously without us have to wait for a response.

      // ? A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing. In this case, our callback function is 'displayRockets', and it's waiting on our 'fetchSpace' function and all of it's promises to resolve before being called and passed data
      
      displayRockets(json);
    });
}

function displayRockets(json) {
  console.log('Results:', json);
  let rockets = json.forEach(r => {
    let rocket = document.createElement('tr');
    let rocketName = document.createElement('td');
    let rocketCost = document.createElement('td');

    rocketName.innerText = r.name;
    rocketCost.innerText = r.cost_per_launch;
    
    spaceShips.appendChild(rocket);
    rocket.appendChild(rocketName);
    rocket.appendChild(rocketCost);

  })
}

// Challenge! First, find cost per rocket in the object. Then, format both responses into a data table with the headers name and cost. Each rocket should have its own row.
