/* 
    REACT CHALLENGE DAY TWO
    TOPICS HIT:: FETCH() MAP() AND STYLE PROPS

    Bronze--
    In the Day Two component, create a class component.
    That component should use a .fetch() to reach out to the studio ghibli api and return 
    information about comic strips.  Store that information in the component's state, 
    then have it print to the console when state has updated with the studio ghibli data.

    Add an <h2></h2> and use a style prop to style the <h2></h2>.

    Note that styling and grabbing api data function independently!

    use this url for accessing the ghibli api:
    https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films/

    Silver-- 
    Create a functional component called Display
    Use .map() to call your Display component multiple times, 
    with each Display responsible for showing the name from a film to the webpage.
    Use a styling prop to style Display's appearance

    Gold--
    Have your Display Functional Component passed a second prop, this time for the film's description.
    Add a button inside the functional component that will toggle between name and description
    to be displayed.  Note this may require changing Display's component type!
