CODE CHALLENGE 2 - ARRAYS
**************************/

/*
Given 2 arrays:
[10,20,30,40,50,70]
[5,3,2,5]

Create a function that multiplies 'like' indexes ([0] with [0], [1] with [1], etc.) together then place the value in a new array. 

The function you create should return [50, 60, 60, 200] based on the arrays above.

Make sure the values given to the function are an array type and they have data inside of them.

If the first array has more values than the second, return that same number


*/

const tensArray = [10,20,30,40,50,70];
const onesArray = [5,3,2,5];

const multiplyValues = (arr1, arr2) => {
  // is an expression that checks the value and type of the arr1 given, then puts that value in that param
  
  arr1 = typeof arr1 == 'object' && arr1 instanceof Array && arr1.length > 0 ? arr1: false;
  arr2 = typeof arr2 == 'object' && arr2 instanceof Array && arr2.length > 0 ? arr2: false;
  
  let newArray = [];
  
  if (arr1 && arr1) {
    // loop over the first array
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
      if (arr2[i] == undefined) {
        newArray.push(arr1[i] * 1)
      } else {
        newArray.push(arr1[i] * arr2[i])
      }
    }
    return newArray
  } else {
    return 'Error: Please provide valid arrays'
  }

let funArr = multiplyValues(tensArray, onesArray);
console.log(funArr)

/*
Typeof vs Instanceof
What does typeof do again?  What do you think instanceof does?  Are both necessary?  No, but it is better safe than sorry to include them.  Typeof sets it to 'object'; why?  If arrays and objects both give the same typeof answer, including instanceof helps solidify that we are looking for an array.  

Instance of checks the prototype property of a constructor => here, it shows us that we are testing that we have an Array.  The capital 'A' Array is a constructor.  We can append classes to them (like we did with Object.assign() yesterday).  These constructors, at their root, simply give the type that they are working with--Array means that we can ONLY work with arrays.

So by including both typeof and instanceof, we are checking the type to make sure it is nothing other than an array in multiple ways.  Again, is this necessary?  No, but helpful.
*/

console.log([] instanceof Array); //true
console.log(typeof []); // object

console.log({} instanceof Object); //true
console.log(typeof {}); // object

/*
Ternary operators (recap) 
arr1 = typeof arr1 == 'object' && arr1 instanceof Array && arr1.length > 0 ? arr1: false;

same as

if (typeof arr1 == 'object && arr1 instanceof Array == true && arr1.length > 0) {
  ...
}

/**************************
PIE CLIENT WALKTHROUGH 2 - FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS
**************************/

/*
Explain React basics again
Flow structure
  App.js
  Return keyword => packages and spits out data (one piece of data)

  Briefly explain JSX
  Like HTML
  className, not class; why?
  Nest all in one div tag
  
  Explain how Functional Components are really just functions
*/
 
 /*
 Building Functional Component
 
 Go to pieclient app and npm start
 See existing site (PIES!)
 
 Add navbar.js inside src folder.
 Add the following:
 
 const Navbar = () => {
   return (
     <div className="navbar">
     something
     </div>
    )
  }
  
Explain that fun.comps. have pascal case
  Remind them that this is the exact same as normal fat arrow function

Return keyword again
  When one value, it's just return something; with JSX, wrap it in ()

JSX again

In app.js, add the following

return (
  <div className="app">
    + <Navbar />
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  )

import Navbar from './navbar'; at the top => explain
  Run => why isn't it working??

Add import React from 'react'; at top of navbar.js => explain linking to package.json/node_modules
  Run again, still nothing!

Add export default Navbar; at bottom of navbar.js
  Run => should see desired component working

Give 30 minutes to make a good navbar
  create a navbar.css file and import to the top of navbar.js
