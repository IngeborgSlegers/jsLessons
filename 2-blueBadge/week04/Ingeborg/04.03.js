CODE CHALLENGE 3 - STRINGS
**************************/

/*
Given the string -> 'Welcome to eleven fifty'

Create a function that accepts a string. 
    
In the function check to see if the value of the string is: 
- of type string
- has a length greater than zero
- has a length less than 30

If any of these are invalid send it to the else condition and show the message -> 'String must not be empty, null, or exceed 30 characters'

If the string is valid, change the string so that the 'e' and the first 'f' in 'eleven fifty' is capitalized

Make sure that trailing whitespace is trimmed off of the string. 

If finished, add a second param to the function for a callback function and instead of returning the data, place it inside of the callback arguments

      - sending plain text passwords to a database is extremely insecure, so we need to use something like bcryptjs to send a hashed password to our database
      - hashing: process of storing passwords in hashed form. This guards against the possibilty of someone gaining unauthorized access to our database and retrieving user passwords.
          - hashing performs a one-way password transformation on a password, turning it into another string called a hashed password.
              - one-way transformation basically means that it's practically impossible to turn the hashed password back into the original password.
                  - there are complex hashing algorithms used to unhash a password, but it's very hard to do.
          - the hashed password value is not encrypted before it's stored in the database. When a user attempts to login, it takes the supplied password, performs a similar one-way hash and compares it to the database value, and checks if the passwords match.
      - salting: 10 stands for the number of times the password will be 'salted'. A salt is basically random data that is unique to each user, that is saved with the users password and is used in the hashing process of both storing and verifying the password.

          - when we create a user, we're signing a token to that user based off their user id. That token expires in 1 day
          - 60 seconds, 60 minutes, 24 hours = 1 day. 60*60*24 gives us 86,400, which is how many seconds there are in a day.

          What is a token? 
            - A JWT is compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
            - Think of the token as a stamp or bracelet at an event. 
          
          Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:
            - Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.
            - Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.
