Broken React App Challenge

* 1. Main.js import should be from './components/Main'; WES

* 2. Extra Parenthesis in toggle villain surrounding the character; WES

* 3. No parent <div> in Main's return; //FOUND

* 4. VillainButton is not being exported; MARTHINUS

* 5. Main.js's import for useState is incorrect, should be wrapped in curly braces; ERIC R

* 6. in the map for characters, the .map() character param is capitalized, all other times it is lower case; KELLIE

* 7. Sneaky Error,in the .map() - when there are more than one param in the .map() they need to be wrapped in parenthesis 

* 8. HeroButton is not taking in props as a parameter, so they are all undefined; //FOUND

* 9. Style prop app.js is wrapped in quotes, not { }; PHILIP

* 10. Two returns in Main; ERIC W

* 11. MapData()'s .map() returns should have a key placed on the containing <div>, not the second one [ this was a warning ]
