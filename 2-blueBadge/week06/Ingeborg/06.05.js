**************************
DAY 5 REACT CHALLENGE
**************************
  Broken PERN App Challenge

  Links to Ingeborg's Broken App Repos:
    React: https://github.com/AlecxMoritz/react-app-challenge;
    Node: https://github.com/AlecxMoritz/react-app-challenge;

  The students are put into pods/groups of 3 or 4.
  As a group, they have to debug the two repos. 
  Students are not familiar with team git yet, so they have to do some peer coding and verbal communication between the front end and the back end to solve this challenge.
